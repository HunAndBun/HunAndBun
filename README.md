  The name 'Hun and Bun' is because we're married IRL, and got into the habit of calling eachother "hun-bun" as pet-names, so naturally it came up when we were thinking of what to call ourselves. 
  Separately, we go by "Arrow" and "rutrine" as online pseudonyms.

     <h3>About:</h3>
     I love to learn. Over the years, lots of hobbies have come and gone, but software development is one that stuck. I started the self-taught journey in highschool learning GameMaker Studio, and eventually transitioned to Unity, and later on Godot. Along the way I've made an <a href="https://github.com/HunAndBun    /ArrowUtilities">open source class library</a> for Unity development, and a few small games with the help of rutrine and her art. A smaller subset of those games actually made their way onto <a href="https://hun-bun.itch.io">our itch.io page.</a> Early 2023 I bought a server to self-host alternatives to software I was previously paying subscription fees for, namely a family Nextcloud to replace my Google One subscription, and GitLab for storing game code directly alongside large art assets that GitHub wasn't too happy about. Most of my focus now is split between my day job, development in Godot, and pursuing a CS degree!
